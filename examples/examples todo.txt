1. Player/missile example (like eg: yellow sub)
2. Sound example (play a tune)
3. Scrolling example
4. "Vector graphics" example (if VG implemented)

Can convert ASM examples to 5200BAS.

NB: Simple examples should be "BASIC only" (ie: allow writing of beginner programs without having to know about DLIST or PMBASE or sDMACTL or whatever)
