Hunting with Dick for the Atari 5200 

Dick is a life long outdoor sports enthusiast who enjoys 
hunting and shooting guns.  

In this game you play the part of Dick (yellow shirt) who
is on a hunting trip with his buddies Harry (blue shirt)
and Oscar (green shirt).

Preparing for the big hunt, Dick is trying to improve
his aim by shooting at a target but Harry and Oscar keep 
getting in the way.  If Dick can hit the target, he scores
a point which is added to the six digit scoreboard at the 
top of the screen.  

Dick is known to have some health issues and his doctor has
prescribed a heart monitor that Dick has with him at all times.
Dick's heart health is indicated by the markers near the 
top of the screen to the right of the six digit score
board.  At the start of the game Dick has 3 heart health
markers.  

Every 10 times that Dick hits the target, his confidence
increases and his heart heals a little.  To reflect this,
the number of heart health markers increases by one up to
a maximum of 5.

If Dick accidentally shoots Harry or Oscar though,
Dick has a mild heart attack and looses a heart health marker.
If Dick looses all of his heart health markers, it is
GAME OVER for Dick.  In that case, press the START key to 
return to the option screen.

On the option screen, the player can choose a level from
0-5.  The higher the number chosen, the narrower the playfield
is at the start of the game.  Every 100 points earned during
play automatically levels up until the maximum level 5 is 
achieved.

This game was created using 5200bas by Jeffry Johnston
and is based on the source code for another 5200 game
called Shooting Gallery by Sebastian Mihai.

There are a number of features of this game that I am sure 
people will want to adjust.  So, I am including the sources.
Please share back your results. 

Enjoy.
