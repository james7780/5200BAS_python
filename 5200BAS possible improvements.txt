1. Remove GOTO and perhaps other legacy BASIC rubbish
3. CONST name=expr			(define constant)
4. Replace DO...LOOP with WHILE...WEND
6. WAIT VBL or WAIT LINE or WAIT milliseconds 	(wait for next frame, or specific line, or n milliseconds)
8. COLLISION
9. FRAME				(current frame number / attract counter)
10. NTSC				(NTSC or PAL)
11. DEBUGGING                           (output debugging map/sym info for use by emulator)
12. More user-friendly documentation
	- Examples
	- Images

Too much "pointer" stuff. Should be made easy for beginners (not have to worry about where the sprite data is, 
or where the display list is, etc). Use "DATA SPRITE" or "DEFINE SPRITE(n)" and have the pointer/address stuff 
done automatically.

Make sprites easier to work with:
	- DEFSPRITE n, label, size
	- PUTSPRITE n, x, y

Add VSCROLL <0...15> command (updates the display list)
Add HSCROLL <0...15> command (updates the HSCROL register)


ATTRACT should be RESETATTRACT

CHARSET should be deprecated tp SET CHARSET
- [DONE] should give an error if address not on page boundary (LSB shoud be 0x00)

DATA help should say it should be associated with a label (ie: there is no READ statement)

DLIST should be deprecated to SET DLIST
- (should also check for going over page boundary?)

DO [WHILE] [UNTIL] could be replaced with WHILE...BREAK...WEND

Subroutines called by GOSUB should be clearly marked as subroutines,
else allow GOSUB <sub> with SUB <name> ... END SUB.
Generate warning if GOTO in a subroutine.

SOUND should take note name or midi note number (eg: "C3", "Eb4")

ENVELOPE <channel>, <name> - set channel n to use envelope data at label <name> (end with an 0xFF)

Could also do basic checks for:
	- memory overlaps
	- interrupt routine locations
	- [DONE] dlist and charset addresses

[DONE] More informative error messages

From INtyBasic:
CONST
WAIT (for frame end)




Diff between version "k" and version "l": 
VERSION$ - 1.96 to 1.97
OPTIONS$(19) added ("VECTTBL", default to "BD00")
global SCRHGT added 
Display list setup now handles ANTIC modes 2 to 15 and uses SCRHGT
SCREEN command now handles ANTIC modes 2 to 15 and sets up SCRHGT
Keypad debounce modified
WIP - vector graphics


Python-specific:
1. [DONE] Use maps for OPTIONS arrays
2. [DONE] Use map for SCRMODE to SCRHGT

[DONE] Python script should call DASM with the correct filename/options if compilation is successful.

- [DONE] No error if DASM fails
- [DONE] User needs warning messages about sprites addr not on 1K or 2K boundary
- User needs warning about PRINT not working in mode 5 and 7
- SPRITES ON needs to set GRACTL
- Need to fix PUT / PUTSPRITE
- Add WAITVBL <line> command
- Fix FOR...NEXT
